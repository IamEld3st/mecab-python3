# The immediate upstream for this software is the PyPI package "mecab-python3",
# which is maintained at Github: https://github.com/SamuraiT/mecab-python3
# The file MeCab.i is copied verbatim from MeCab proper, which is also
# theoretically maintained at Github: https://github.com/taku910/mecab
# However, there has not been a change that affected that file since
# 2013, so we currently do not bother monitoring that repository.
